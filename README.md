# Smoke
Cooking fumes are the most frequently exposed and easily ignored air pollution sources in daily life. Oil and meat will produce a variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at excessively high temperatures, including benzene, toluene, xylene, benzopyrene and other benzene series, which are toxic to organisms, directly affect human health, and can seriously cause cancer [1]. Therefore, we designed a device that can detect the carcinogens VOCs and temperature in cooking fume, and display the monitored carcinogens content through the screen in real time. When the carcinogens content is found to exceed the standard, the alarm and remote warning information are immediately issued to remind people to stop cooking in time.
